# The Mini Movie DB

## What is this?

The Mini Movie DB is a simple clone of The Movie DB built with Preact and GraphQL. It's an example application which runs inside of CodeSandbox with a back-end built and ran in Apollo Launchpad.

I built The Mini Movie DB as part of a take-home coding challenge. You can use it as an example of how to build a simple Preact + GraphQL application! Have fun!

## Okay, so how do I use this?

For now, the best way to run this code is to simply go to it's [CodeSandbox Page](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/Saeris/mini-movie-db)!

There you can both see it in action and edit the code live in your browser.

If you'd like to take a look at the back-end code, you can view that over on [Apollo Launchpad](https://launchpad.graphql.com/lk3jvvvjnq).

Want to run this locally? Instructions for that are coming sonnâ„¢!
